    <h3> What is CPI? How is inflation calculated? </h3>
     <p> The Consumer Price Index tracks changes in the cost of a representative “basket” of goods and services that urban consumers buy.
         Inflation is simply the percentage change in that index. So if CPI rises from 300 to 309, inflation is 3 percent.</p>
    <h3> CPI Data before 1912 </h3>
    <p> CPI data from before the year 1912 is more speculatory than more recent years, due to it being a very long time ago.
         Although it's still accurate when you think about it. </p>
